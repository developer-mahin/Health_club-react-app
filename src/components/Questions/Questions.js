                            <p>At its very core, React basically maintains a tree for you. This tree is able to do efficient diff computations on the nodes. Think of your HTML code as a tree. In fact, that is exactly how the browser treats your DOM (your rendered HTML on the browser). React allows you to effectively re-construct your DOM in JavaScript and push only those changes to the DOM which have actually occurred.</p>

                            <p><strong>Props: </strong>Props are immutable that is their content cannot be changed once assigned. Set by event handlers that are they are completely managed by the component itself. Props allows child components to read values from parent components</p>
                            <p><strong>State: </strong> React state is mutable and its value can be changed as per requirement. Set by parent component . State is local to a component and cannot be used in other components.</p>

                            <p>The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components. Some side effects include fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and set timers.</p>
